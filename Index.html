<h3>Message From The chairman</h3>
<img src="C:\Users\basan\OneDrive\Desktop\m.jpg">
<P>
 When it comes to our sustained efforts aimed at positioning Samriddhi
 as an educational institution of repute, we start by asking ourselves
 so me fundamental questions – how can we prepare our students for the 
 disruptions that is set to characterize the 21st Century? What specific 
 cmpetencies, skill sets and academic grounding would be required for a 
 student to succeed in the frenetic pace of change that is so much a part
 of this day and age? And perhaps more importantly, how can we adequately
 factor in Nepali ground realities in our efforts aimed at achieving
 educational outcomes aligned with the imperatives demanded by the 
 dynamism of the modern times and overarching national aspirations that 
 have been unleashed?<br>
 These questions form the broad framework within which our academic 
 orientation and learning environment that we nurture here at Samriddhi 
 are rooted. We make concerted effort to move beyond traditional, 
 normative and structured approach to education to ensure that our 
 students are equipped with foundational grounding that would set them on 
 a course to overall success and achievement. In doing so, we remain 
 educational ecosystem comprising of teachers, parents and students.<br>

 Our focus will not be on academic rigor alone but equally on other 
 aspects of human attributes that play a role in helping students grow 
 into global citizens.<br>

 let me take this opportunity to invite you all to be a part of this
 exciting journey. At this juncture, let me assure all you parents and
 students of our unflinching commitment for quality education.<br>
